The journey of EVs started a long time ago. During the first half of the 19th century, the exploration of electrical automobiles started by several researchers of the United States, Netherlands, and Hungary. The researches lead to the invention of the first EV practical prototype by Robert Anderson.India has been a major importer of crude oil. In the year 2019-20 the import bill was around $100 billion which is a huge strain on the countryâ€™s exchequer. One possible solution to this is the augmented use of alternative fuels. Since the production of biofuels is abundance in India and it requires minimal infrastructural changes for large scale adoption, it can serve as a much easier solution to the issue. But the creation of supply chain for regular use of Biofuels is still in nascent stage.Emphasising on electric mobility suggest a proper way for the creation of supply chain for the consistent use of Biofuels.
